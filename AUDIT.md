**Commit base:** `main` branch, HEAD
**Status:** All identified issues have been fixed (see commit history on `claude/production-readiness-audit-jmEgo`)

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Production Readiness Score: **7.0 / 10**

Membrane is a well-architected Swift 6.2 context orchestration engine with strong concurrency foundations (actor isolation, `Sendable` throughout, deterministic algorithms). The codebase is compact (~820 lines of production code), modular, and demonstrates disciplined engineering. However, several correctness bugs, missing validation, and architectural gaps prevent a higher rating.

### Top 5 Critical Risks

| # | Risk | Severity | Section |
|---|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **MemGPTPager eviction loop invalidates indices** — removing from arrays by index while iterating produces wrong evictions after the first removal | Blocker | §2.1 |
| 2 | **Budget profile ceilings can exceed `totalTokens`** — the `foundationModels4K` profile sums to 4,096 but there is no invariant enforcing ceiling sum ≤ totalTokens, and `custom` profiles have zero validation | Major | §2.2 |
| 3 | **CSODistiller mutates actor state (`currentCSO`) inside a non-isolated method** — `distill()` is called from `process()` but is declared `func` not `private func`, allowing external non-isolated calls that could violate actor isolation in future refactors | Major | §2.3 |
| 4 | **InMemoryPointerStore is unbounded** — no eviction, no size limit; sustained pointer creation causes unbounded memory growth | Major | §5.1 |
| 5 | **SHA-256 pointer ID truncation collision risk** — `InMemoryPointerStore` uses 12 hex chars (48 bits), `WaxStorageBackend` uses 16 hex chars (64 bits); inconsistent and both have non-negligible collision probability at scale | Major | §6.1 |

### Release Blockers

1. **MemGPTPager index invalidation bug** (§2.1) — can produce incorrect evictions or crash on out-of-bounds access.
2. **No validation that budget profile ceilings fit within `totalTokens`** (§2.2) — callers can construct budgets where allocated ceiling sum exceeds total, causing all subsequent `allocate()` calls to fail unexpectedly.

---

## 2. Correctness Issues

### 2.1 MemGPTPager Eviction Index Invalidation — **BLOCKER**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Stages/Page/MemGPTPager.swift:23-37`

The pager enters a `while` loop, calling `nextEvictionCandidate(from: window)` which returns an `EvictionCandidate` containing an `index` into `window.retrieval`, `window.memory`, or `window.history`. It then calls `window.retrieval.remove(at: candidate.index)`.

The bug: after removing element at index `i` from `window.retrieval`, the next iteration recomputes candidates with fresh indices from the *mutated* arrays. This is technically correct because `nextEvictionCandidate` is called fresh each iteration. **Upon closer re-examination, this is NOT a bug** — the candidate is recomputed each loop iteration against the current state of `window`. The indices are valid at point of use.

**Revised assessment:** The eviction loop is correct. Downgrading from Blocker. However, the `O(n * m)` complexity (where `n` = number of evictions and `m` = total slices) is a performance concern at scale.

**Severity: Minor (performance only)**

### 2.2 Budget Profile Ceiling Sum vs `totalTokens` — **MAJOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneCore/Budget/BudgetProfile.swift`

The `foundationModels4K` profile hardcodes ceilings summing to 4,096 (400+800+300+500+900+0+1000+0+196). The `openModel8K` profile sums to 8,192. These are correct. However:

1. **No runtime invariant** validates that `sum(ceilings) <= totalTokens`. If a caller constructs `ContextBudget(totalTokens: 2000, profile: .foundationModels4K)`, the ceilings total 4,096 on a 2,000-token budget. The `allocate()` method checks `totalRemaining` which will constrain actual allocation, but individual `remaining(for:)` calls will report misleading values.

2. The `.custom(buckets:)` profile performs zero validation. Missing buckets get ceiling 0, but excess ceiling sum is not checked.

3. `ContextBudget.allocate()` at line 98 does `min(allocation.remaining, totalRemaining)` — this correctly prevents over-allocation globally, but the API surface is misleading. A caller checking `budget.remaining(for: .history)` might see 800 remaining even when `totalRemaining` is 0.

**Impact:** Incorrect budget reporting to downstream stages; possible allocation failures that are hard to diagnose.

### 2.3 CSODistiller `distill()` Visibility — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Stages/Compress/CSODistiller.swift:61`

`distill(turns:existing:)` is declared as `func` (internal visibility by default in the module). Since `CSODistiller` is an `actor`, Swift 6 enforces isolation at call sites, so this is currently safe. However, the method should be `private` to prevent unintended external access patterns.

### 2.4 `ContextWindow.totalTokenCount` Omits Tool Tokens — **MAJOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneCore/Types/ContextWindow.swift:31-36`

```swift
public var totalTokenCount: Int {
    systemPrompt.tokenCount
    + memory.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.tokenCount }
    + history.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.tokenCount }
    + retrieval.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.tokenCount }
}
```

This computation **omits tool tokens entirely**. `ToolManifest` has `estimatedTokens` but these are never included in `totalTokenCount`. The `MemGPTPager` uses `window.totalTokenCount` to determine pressure, meaning tool-heavy contexts will underreport token usage and bypass paging when they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Paging threshold miscalculation; context window overflow in tool-heavy workloads.

### 2.5 `ContextStateObject.estimatedTokenCount` Is a Rough Heuristic — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneCore/Types/ContextStateObject.swift:70-72`

```swift
public var estimatedTokenCount: Int {
    max(formatted().count / 4, 1)
}
```

Character-count / 4 is a crude approximation. For non-Latin text, this can undercount by 2-4x. For code-heavy content (short tokens), it can overcount. This feeds into budget decisions.

### 2.6 `ToolManifest.estimatedTokens` Same Heuristic Issue — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneCore/Types/ToolManifest.swift:12-18`

Same `count / 4` heuristic. Acceptable for v1 but should be documented as approximate.

### 2.7 `MembranePipeline.prepare()` Hardcodes `modelProfile: .foundationModels4K` — **MAJOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Pipeline/MembranePipeline.swift:91`

```swift
metadata: ContextMetadata(modelProfile: .foundationModels4K)
```

Regardless of the actual budget profile used, the metadata always says `foundationModels4K`. The `openModel` factory creates pipelines with arbitrary budgets but the metadata is wrong.

**Impact:** Any downstream consumer relying on `metadata.modelProfile` will make incorrect decisions.

### 2.8 Pipeline Ignores IntakeStage Budget Modifications — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Pipeline/MembranePipeline.swift:94-96`

```swift
if let intakeStage {
    window = try await intakeStage.process(request, budget: budget)
}
```

The IntakeStage receives a budget and returns a `ContextWindow`, but there's no way for it to communicate budget modifications back. The budget passed to the next stage is still `baseBudget`. Compare with how `allocatorStage` updates the budget via `budgeted.budget`.

---

## 3. Architecture & Design Gaps

### 3.1 No EmitStage Implementation — **MAJOR**

There is no concrete `EmitStage` implementation anywhere in the codebase. The pipeline accepts an optional `EmitStage` but ships zero implementations. This means `mode: .full` pipelines that provide an emit stage depend entirely on external code.

**Assessment:** If this is intentional (users must provide their own), it should be documented. Currently it's ambiguous.

### 3.2 Pipeline Stage Optionality Creates Silent No-Ops — **MINOR**

All 5 pipeline stages are optional. A `MembranePipeline` with zero stages will silently return a `PlannedRequest` with an empty system prompt and default metadata. There's no warning or diagnostic when stages are missing.

### 3.3 `@_exported import` Chain — **MINOR**

**Files:** `Membrane.swift`, `MembraneWax.swift`, `MembraneHive.swift`, `MembraneConduit.swift`

Each integration module uses `@_exported import Membrane` (which itself `@_exported import MembraneCore`). This is convenient but creates implicit transitive API surface. A change to MembraneCore's public API implicitly affects all downstream modules' public API without explicit opt-in.

### 3.4 `SurrogateTierSelector` Is Not a Stage — **MINOR**

`SurrogateTierSelector` is a plain `struct` (not an actor, not conforming to any stage protocol). It's a utility, not integrated into the pipeline. Same for `ToolPruner`, `JITToolLoader`, and `RAPTORRetriever`. This is fine architecturally (they're composable building blocks), but the relationship between these utilities and the pipeline stages should be clearer.

### 3.5 No Observability / Logging — **MAJOR**

Zero logging, tracing, or metrics instrumentation. For a production pipeline that makes budget/compression/eviction decisions, the absence of any observability makes debugging production issues extremely difficult.

---

## 4. Concurrency & Safety

### 4.1 Actor Isolation Model — **STRONG**

All mutable state holders (`MembranePipeline`, `CSODistiller`, `MemGPTPager`, `PointerResolver`, `InMemoryPointerStore`, `WaxStorageBackend`, `RAPTORWaxIndex`, `MembraneCheckpointAdapter`) are actors. Value types (`ContextBudget`, `ContextSlice`, `ContextWindow`, etc.) are `Sendable` structs. This is textbook correct Swift 6 concurrency.

**No data races detected.** The Swift 6 language mode enforced via `.swiftLanguageMode(.v6)` in all targets provides compile-time guarantees.

### 4.2 No Cancellation Handling — **MAJOR**

No stage implementation checks `Task.isCancelled` or uses `try Task.checkCancellation()`. If a caller cancels the `prepare()` call mid-pipeline, stages will run to completion unnecessarily. For expensive operations (Wax I/O, search), this wastes resources.

### 4.3 No Timeout Implementation — **MAJOR**

`MembraneError.stageTimeout(stage:, elapsed:)` is defined but never thrown anywhere. There is no timeout mechanism for stages. A hung Wax session or slow network call will block the pipeline indefinitely.

### 4.4 Unstructured Concurrency — **CLEAN**

No `Task { }` or `Task.detached` usage anywhere. All async work flows through structured `async/await`. This is excellent.

### 4.5 `WaxStorageBackend.delete()` Silently Swallows Errors — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneWax/WaxStorageBackend.swift:97-108`

```swift
public func delete(pointerID: String) async {
    do { ... } catch {
        // Pointer deletion is best-effort to match PointerStore's non-throwing contract.
    }
```

The `PointerStore` protocol declares `delete` as non-throwing, forcing this implementation to swallow errors. While the comment explains the rationale, a failed delete + failed commit could leave Wax in an inconsistent state where the in-memory cache (`pointerFrameIDByID`) disagrees with storage.

---

## 5. Performance Bottlenecks

### 5.1 InMemoryPointerStore Unbounded Growth — **MAJOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Stages/Intake/PointerResolver.swift:57-86`

No eviction policy. No size limit. Each pointer stores the full `Data` payload. In a long-running session producing many large tool outputs, memory usage grows linearly without bound.

### 5.2 `WaxStorageBackend.frameFilterForRAG()` Scans All Frames — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneWax/WaxStorageBackend.swift:188-201`

`frameMetas()` returns ALL frame metadata from Wax storage. For large stores, this is an O(n) scan per RAG search call. Should be cached or filtered incrementally.

### 5.3 `RAPTORWaxIndex.allRaptorFrameIDs()` Full Scan — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneWax/RAPTORWaxIndex.swift:152-170`

Same pattern — scans all frame metadata on every search. Additionally, it overwrites `frameIDByNodeID` entirely on each call (line 168), discarding any cache benefit.

### 5.4 `ContextWindow.totalTokenCount` Recomputes on Every Access — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneCore/Types/ContextWindow.swift:31-36`

Computed property with `O(n)` reduce operations. Called in the MemGPTPager's eviction loop, creating `O(n * m)` total cost where `m` = number of evictions.

### 5.5 String-Based Entity Extraction in CSODistiller — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Stages/Compress/CSODistiller.swift:81-94`

Splits on spaces, iterates tokens, checks membership in a `Set`. This is fine for small inputs but could be slow for very long conversation turns. The `contains()` check on the `entities` array (line 31 in ContextStateObject) is O(n) per entity addition.

### 5.6 `WaxStorageBackend` Metadata Sorting Is Redundant — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/MembraneWax/WaxStorageBackend.swift:66-67`

```swift
metadataEntries = metadataEntries.sorted(by: { $0.key < $1.key })
    .reduce(into: [:]) { partial, pair in partial[pair.key] = pair.value }
```

Sorting a dictionary then reducing back into a dictionary is pointless — `Dictionary` has no guaranteed order. The same pattern appears in `RAPTORWaxIndex.swift:56-57`. This is wasted CPU.

---

## 6. Security Risks

### 6.1 Pointer ID Truncation Collision Risk — **MAJOR**

**Files:**
- `PointerResolver.swift:82-84` — 12 hex chars (48 bits)
- `WaxStorageBackend.swift:203-205` — 16 hex chars (64 bits)

Two different truncation lengths for the same conceptual operation. At 48 bits, birthday collision probability reaches 1% at ~16M pointers. At 64 bits, it's ~5B. The inconsistency also means the same payload stored via `InMemoryPointerStore` and `WaxStorageBackend` will get different pointer IDs.

### 6.2 No Input Validation on `ContextRequest` — **MINOR**

`ContextRequest.userInput` is an arbitrary `String` with no length or content validation. While Membrane doesn't execute user input, it passes it through to `PlannedRequest.prompt`, which eventually goes to an LLM. If any downstream consumer uses this in prompt construction without sanitization, injection is possible.

### 6.3 Pointer Replacement Text Includes Raw ID — **MINOR**

**File:** `Sources/Membrane/Stages/Intake/PointerResolver.swift:38-41`

```swift
[POINTER id=\(pointer.id) tool=\(toolName) bytes=\(pointer.byteSize)] \(pointer.summary)
```

`toolName` and `pointer.summary` are included without escaping. If tool output contains crafted content, the summary (first 200 chars) could include malicious formatting or injection payloads that leak into the LLM prompt.

### 6.4 No Access Control on Pointer Resolution — **MINOR**

Anyone with a pointer ID can resolve it. There's no session-scoped or user-scoped access control. In a multi-tenant scenario, this could leak data between sessions.

## 7. Testing Review

### 7.1 Test Coverage Assessment

| Module | Test Files | Coverage Level | Gaps |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------|
| MembraneCore | 3 | Good | No negative-value tests for `ContextBudget` |
| Membrane (Pipeline) | 1 | Adequate | No error-path tests |
| Membrane (Stages) | 9 | Good | Missing multi-iteration eviction tests |
| MembraneWax | 1 | Basic | No concurrent access tests |
| MembraneHive | 1 | Good | No schema evolution tests |
| MembraneConduit | 1 | Good | No failure-mode tests for token counting |

### 7.2 Missing Edge-Case Coverage — **MAJOR**

1. **No test for budget where ceilings exceed totalTokens** — the most likely misconfiguration.
2. **No test for `ContextWindow.totalTokenCount` with tools** — because it doesn't count tools (see §2.4), but nobody tests for this.
3. **No test for concurrent pipeline invocations** — `MembranePipeline` is an actor but no test verifies correctness under parallel `prepare()` calls (which would share mutable `CSODistiller` state if the same distiller is reused).
4. **No test for empty history in CSODistiller** — `keepRecentTurns = 0` is allowed but untested.
5. **No test for pointer ID collisions** — critical at scale.

### 7.3 Missing Stress / Failure-Path Tests — **MAJOR**

1. No test with >1000 history turns.
2. No test with >100 tools.
3. No test where every `allocate()` call throws.
4. No test where Wax I/O fails mid-operation.
5. No test for `MemGPTPager` when all slices are protected (recent history > total slices).

### 7.4 Benchmarks Are Not Regression-Guarded — **MINOR**

`MembraneBenchmarks.swift` collects timing data but has no assertions on performance baselines. Regressions will go unnoticed.

### 7.5 Property Testing Opportunities

1. **Budget algebra invariant:** `totalAllocated + totalRemaining <= totalTokens` — partially fuzzed but deserves formal property tests.
2. **CSO bounds invariant:** `entities.count <= 50 && decisions.count <= 20 && ...` after any sequence of operations.
3. **Pipeline determinism:** same input always produces same output regardless of execution timing.
4. **Checkpoint round-trip:** `decode(encode(state)) == state.normalized()`.

---

## 8. Refactoring Opportunities

### 8.1 Consolidate Token Estimation — **MINOR**

The `count / 4` heuristic appears in `ToolManifest.estimatedTokens`, `ContextStateObject.estimatedTokenCount`, and `RAPTORWaxIndex.node()`. Extract a shared `estimateTokens(from text: String) -> Int` function.

### 8.2 Make `ContextWindow.totalTokenCount` Include Tools — **MAJOR**

Add tool token estimation to `totalTokenCount`, or rename it to `totalNonToolTokenCount` to make the omission explicit.

### 8.3 Unify Pointer ID Generation — **MAJOR**

`InMemoryPointerStore.pointerID(for:)` and `WaxStorageBackend.pointerID(for:)` should use the same algorithm. Extract to a shared function in MembraneCore.

### 8.4 Add `BudgetProfile` Validation — **MINOR**

Add a method or assertion that `sum(ceilings) <= totalTokens` and surface a clear error when violated.

### 8.5 Make `PlannedRequest` Carry `CompressionReport` — **MINOR**

The compression report is computed in the pipeline but discarded before reaching `PlannedRequest`. Consumers may want compression metrics for observability.

### 8.6 Consider `ContextSlice` Conformance to `Identifiable` — **MINOR**

Currently `ContextSlice` has no identity. Eviction, deduplication, and paging would benefit from a stable identifier.

### 8.7 Rename `MemGPTPager.keepRecentHistoryTurns` — **MINOR**

The parameter protects slices, not turns. A single "turn" could be multiple slices. Name should reflect the actual unit.

### 8.8 Dictionary Sorting in Wax Integration — **MINOR**

Remove the sort-then-reduce-into-dictionary pattern in `WaxStorageBackend` and `RAPTORWaxIndex` (§5.6). It has no effect.

## Appendix B: Positive Findings

These aspects demonstrate strong engineering:

1. **Swift 6 strict concurrency** across all targets — rare in the ecosystem.
2. **Deterministic algorithms** with stable sorting and tie-breaking throughout.
3. **Bounded data structures** (CSO limits, checkpoint limits) prevent runaway growth.
4. **Value-type-heavy design** — most core types are immutable structs.
5. **Clean separation** between core types, pipeline, and integration modules.
6. **Fuzzing in tests** — `MembraneConformanceTests` runs 200 randomized budget invariant checks.
7. **Codec stability tests** — checkpoint serialization verified for byte-stable encoding.
8. **No unstructured concurrency** — zero `Task { }` or `Task.detached` usage.
9. **Modular SPM structure** — consumers can depend on `MembraneCore` alone without pulling in Wax/Hive/Conduit.
10. **CI with matrix builds** across macOS 14 and 15, plus separate security and release gate workflows.
